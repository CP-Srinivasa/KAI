"""momentum_cohort_outcomes — G3 shadow→eval bridge.

Extracts resolved ``momentum_universe``-cohort closed trades from the paper
execution audit into ``{symbol, entry_ts, net_bps}`` rows that
``scripts/evaluate_momentum_evidence.py`` point-in-time-joins against the momentum
evidence shadow log. Reuses the edge_report cost SSOT (``compute_trade_edge`` /
``CostModel``) — no second fee formula. Corrupt/quarantined closes are dropped by
``parse_closed_trades_with_exclusions`` (the same integrity guard the edge-report
uses). The close timestamp is used as ``entry_ts``: it is strictly after the
shadow measurement (written at signal time), so the PIT-join pairs each
measurement with the close it led to (no look-ahead).
