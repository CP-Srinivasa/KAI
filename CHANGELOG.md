  - `actionable` missing in `69/69`
  - `market_scope` unknown in `69/69`
  - `tags` empty in `69/69`
  - `relevance_score` default-floor in `56/69`
- Governance state updated to:
  - `current_sprint = PH4F_RULE_INPUT_COMPLETENESS_AUDIT (ready to close)`
  - `next_required_step = PH4F_RESULTS_REVIEW_AND_PH4G_SELECTION`
- Baseline unchanged: `1519 passed`, `ruff clean`.

## 2026-03-23 - PH4E closed and PH4F opened (historical)

- PH4E scoring calibration audit formally closed (D-67).
